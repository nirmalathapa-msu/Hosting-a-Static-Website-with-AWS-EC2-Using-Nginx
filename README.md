**Introduction to AWS EC2
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) core service that provides resizable and scalable virtual server instances in the cloud. It is a flexible computing resource that enables users to launch and operate virtual servers, called instances, based on their computational requirements. EC2 instances can be used for various applications, including web hosting, application deployment, data processing, machine learning, and more.

Basically, EC2 is like a magic store where you can rent any laptop to run your program over the Internet. Instead of having different physical computers in front of you, you can tell the store how powerful your computers should be and how long you want to use them.
This store will create these virtual computers (instances) and give you access. Hence, you can operate numerous virtual computers on a single piece of physical hardware.**
